# Ness Botanic Gardens Visitor App
The repository for my COMP390 final year project. It contains the source code for both the iOS and watchOS apps.

## Features


## Download and build instructions

The app can be tested without the need to build the source code if you own an M1 series Mac. Download the latest Mac release from the [releases](https://github.com/jakedarby24/Ness-Botanic-Garden-Project/releases) page and run it. You will be told by macOS that the app cannot run. Press OK.

Navigate to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General. From here, click Open Anyway to run the app.

You can now use the app as if you are running it on an iPad, with mostly the same functionality as the iOS app. The main notable feature that is missing from this app is notifications, as it's not very useful to carry your laptop around the gardens with you; this is more for testing purposes if you're curious about running the app.
