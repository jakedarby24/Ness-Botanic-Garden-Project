# Ness Botanic Gardens Visitor App
The repository for my COMP390 final year project. It contains the source code for both the iOS and watchOS apps.

## Features

### Map

The map is the homescreen of the app; it allows you to search and filter landmarks, as well as view more information about everything within the gardens.

### Trails

The trails section shows four different designated, signposted walking trails that exist throughout the gardens. The nature trails just show routes, whereas the tree trails show landmarks along the way. The user can get more information about these trails by tapping on the i button next to the trail name.

### Places and Flora tabs

These two tabs provide information on the garden sections and flora at the Botanic Gardens. It displays how far away you are from the specified landmark, as well as providing more information if you tap on one of the rows in the table.

### Notifications

If 'Always' location is permitted, alongside notification privileges, the app can provide notifications for when you are close to a given landmark within the gardens. If the user has an Apple Watch, this permits them to view information directly on their watch of the closest landmark.

## Download and build instructions

The app can be tested without the need to build the source code if you own an M1 series Mac. Download the latest Mac release from the [releases](https://github.com/jakedarby24/Ness-Botanic-Garden-Project/releases) page and run it. You will be told by macOS that the app cannot run. Press OK.

Navigate to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General. From here, click Open Anyway to run the app.

You can now use the app as if you are running it on an iPad, with mostly the same functionality as the iOS app. The main notable feature that is missing from this app is notifications, as it's not very useful to carry your laptop around the gardens with you; this is more for testing purposes if you're curious about running the app.
